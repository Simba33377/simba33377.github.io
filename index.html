  <h1> Hurricane Irma: Devastating Catastrophe</h1>
  <body style="background-color:rgb(242, 247, 255);">

<p style="font-size: 200%;">  Hurricane Irma  was a very strong hurricane that first hit near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave that started
       off of the West African coast and quickly became a Category 2 hurricane. Fast forward five days to September 4 and
        suddenly it has become Category 4. For the next few days it changes between category 4 and 5.</p>

<p style="font-size: 200%;">On September 5 Irma brought serious damage to the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
       and parts of the US with 157 mph winds. On September 10 Irma hit Florida with 150 mph winds and from there slowly became
        a tropical storm. On its way towards Georgia and Alabama it weakened to become a tropical depression then dissipated 
        over Tennessee on September 13th. </p>
    
<p style="font-size: 200%;">Hurricane Irma was the first recorded storm to keep 185 mph for more than 37 hours. At that time Irma was the most 
powerful hurricane to strike the US since hurricane Katrina. It shut down a lot of communication and left 60 percent
of the Antigua and Barbuda population homeless. At its peak Irmas cloud coverage was larger than Texas at more than 
300,000 square miles. Irma and Harveys landfall makes the first recorded year to have two category 4 or stronger
hurricanes during the span of one year.</p>

<p style="font-size: 200%;">Here is some perspective from those impacted by the storm.</p>
<p style="font-size: 200%;">Hi, we are Flood Victims from Hurricane Irma. We live in Jacksonville, Fl. Hurricane Irma hit us on September 11, 2017. 
Thank God we had some friends we were able to stay with who lived on higher ground. Thank God we got out of there and moved
our van. I believe they said the Hurricane was a Category 5. When we were allowed back in, we were told we had to move out 
within 7-10 days and that we needed to throw everything out. The river water was very dirty and it came up 2 feet. They brought
great big dumpsters in and all of us on ground floor filled them with our furniture. It was the most devastated situation i 
have ever been in. I thought i was going to have a nervous breakdown. It was horrible! I wasn’t worried about our belongings
but we came very close to being homeless. I am 69 years old and I take care of my 82 year old uncle. When we get older we 
don’t cope with things as well as when we were younger. Most of our family has passed away and the ones who haven’t are old
and not able to help us. Most of our friends have passed away also, so we came very close to being homeless! We moved two times
and are moving again. This has been a nightmare!!! There is so much to tell but this kind of sums it up! Thank god we received
some help from FEMA and from the country western singers who put on a concert to collect money. Truly we appreciate all the 
prayers, love and concern people have shown us! By the way they have a tentative date to move back in on July 20, 2018. We 
have a lot of work that has to be done as soon as we can get back in. No bodily harm and no lives were lost and we now can see
light at the end of the tunnel!

When they first felt the rising pressure in the room, they moved a mattress up against the large sliding glass windows and put
 a dresser behind that. They sheltered in the bathroom away from the gusting winds, a decision that quickly proved wise.
“We were in the bathroom for probably about 45 minutes, and the windows exploded in the bedroom,” Lachlan Macleay told CNN’s 
Erin Burnett. “We could feel the wind coming down the hallway through the kitchen.”But soon, the bathroom roof started to flex
and water began coming through the cracks in the ceiling. So they moved between the refrigerator and the front door and stood 
in the door frame for the next three to four hours, even as water slowly flooded the room.“At that point, there was about 5 
inches of water on the floor where we were standing,” Kaiann Macleay said. “The whole room was filled with water because the 
roof was leaking, and there was glass everywhere from the sliding glass doors. But the door frame against the metal door was 
really the safest spot.”
 
The couple survived through the storm. In the immediate aftermath, Dr. Macleay helped those injured on the Caribbean island.
But the chaotic period after the storm, in which they watched people begin looting and stealing, was even more frightening. Wary
of looters, Dr. Macleay and others at the resort decided to stay up through the night on patrol with a machete on hand, just in
case.“I was terrified. I was obviously totally relieved and grateful to be alive,” Kaiann Macleay said. “But when I saw the 
devastation, then I was faced with the reality that we were in a really, really bad situation, and it was terrifying.”

was 10 at the time and wrote the book at 12 years old!</p>
