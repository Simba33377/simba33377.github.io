    <p style="font-size: 200%;">  Hurricane Irma  was a very strong hurricane that first hit near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave that started
       off of the West African coast and quickly became a Category 2 hurricane. Fast forward five days to September 4 and
        suddenly it has become Category 4. For the next few days it changes between category 4 and 5.</p>

    <p>On September 5 Irma brought serious damage to the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
       and parts of the US with 157 mph winds. On September 10 Irma hit Florida with 150 mph winds and from there slowly became
        a tropical storm. On its way towards Georgia and Alabama it weakened to become a tropical depression then dissipated 
        over Tennessee on September 13th. </p>
    
        <p>Hurricane Irma was the first recorded storm to keep 185 mph for more than 37 hours. At that time Irma was the most
          powerful hurricane to strike the US since hurricane Katrina. It shut down a lot of communication and left 60 percent
          of the Antigua and Barbuda population homeless. At its peak Irmas cloud coverage was larger than Texas at more than 
          300,000 square miles. Irma and Harveys landfall makes the first recorded year to have two category 4 or stronger
           hurricanes during the span of one year.</p>
